# Fun in the Sun

## Ways to have fun the Summer of 2016
- Make sure that you always have a water bottle(add lemonade for an added touch)
- Plan a trip somewhere(it doesn't have to be long, maybe just short one day trip to another state)
- Try lots of activities(maybe you'll find somehting you want to do during the year)
- Hang out with your friends(summer is no fun without someone to hang with. Maybe hold a lemonade stand to make some extra cash)
- And the most important rule is: RELAX(summer is your vacation from school, so chill out)

## And these are some fun ways to spend your summer
